# KNN_Algorithms_using_DrRacket

KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbours

It is a machine learning algorithm to classify the data points based on the k closest datapoints from the training set.

The code has a insertion sort based pair sort function which sorts based on the distance.


The first-k values of the sorted dataset will be the k-nearest neighbours.
