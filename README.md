# Machine_Learning_Algorithms_using_DrRacket

Some of the basic machine learning algorithms are implemented using DrRacket.

The algorithms include:
1) KNN
2) KMeans
3) Linear Regression
4) Logistic Regression

The project is under development. So, the code in this repository won't perform all the algorithms mentioned above.
