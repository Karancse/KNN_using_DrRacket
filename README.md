# KNN_Algorithms_using_DrRacket

KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbours

It is a machine learning algorithm to classify the data points based on the k closest datapoints from the training set.

The code has a pair sort function ( based on insertion sort ) which sorts the datapoints based on the distance.

The closest k datapoints of the sorted dataset will be the k-nearest neighbours.

The majority class of the k-nearest neighbours will be the class of the given datapoint.
